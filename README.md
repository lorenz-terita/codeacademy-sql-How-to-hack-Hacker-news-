# codeacademy sql: How to hack Hacker news
**Hacker News** is a popular website run by Y Combinator. It’s widely known by people in the tech industry as a community site for sharing news, showing off projects, asking questions, among other things.

In this project, I will be working with a table named **hacker_news** that contains stories from Hacker News since its launch in 2007. It has the following columns:

_title_: the title of the story;
_user_: the user who submitted the story;
_score_: the score of the story;
_timestamp_: the time of the story;
_url_: the link of the story;

This data was kindly made publicly available under the MIT license.

Let’s get started!
